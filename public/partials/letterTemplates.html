                <p>Dear <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Child's Name&GT;</span>,</p>

                <p class="indent">Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas! The Elves and I are busy making presents for all of the good boys and girls around the world. You have been such a good <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Child's Gender&GT;</span> this year, so I wanted
                    to take a minute to write you a letter.</p>

                <p class="indent">I’ve made my Naughty and Nice list, and I’ve checked it twice. You are on my Nice List! I am so happy that you have been such a good <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Child's Gender&GT;</span> this year. I heard from my secret messenger
                    that you want <span class="highlight-red">&LT;What they want for Christmas&GT;</span> for Christmas this year. Because you have been so good, the Elves and I have prepared a special present for you to open on Christmas Morning.</p>

                <p class="indent">Can you do me a favor? I want you to try really hard to <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Something you wish the child to work on&GT;</span> If you can do that for me, then I will be very happy and might bring you an extra treat
                    on Christmas Morning.</p>

                <p class="indent">By the time I get to your house in <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Child's city&GT;</span>, I am going to be very hungry. Would you leave some cookies and milk out for me? Chocolate Chip cookies are my favorite, but I love all
                    kinds of cookies! Well I need to get back to my workshop and help the Elves. Keep up the good work <span class="highlight-red">&LT;Child's Name&GT;</span> and have a Very Merry Christmas!</p>

                <p>Ho Ho Ho,</p>

                <p>Santa Claus</p>
